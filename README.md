#Abstract of Article

To solve the problem of energy constraints and spectrum scarcity for cognitive radio wirelesssensor  networks  (CR-WSNs),  an  underlay  decode-and-forward  relaying  scheme  is  considered,where the energy constrained secondary source and relay nodes are capable of harvesting energyfrom a multi-antenna power beacon (PB) and using that harvested energy to forward the sourceinformation to the destination.  Based on the time switching receiver architecture, three relayingprotocols, namely, hybrid partial relay selection (H-PRS), conventional opportunistic relay selection(C-ORS), and best opportunistic relay selection (B-ORS) protocols are considered to enhance theend-to-end performance under the joint impact of maximal interference constraint and transceiverhardware impairments.   For performance evaluation and comparison,  we derive the exact andasymptotic closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and throughput (TP) to providesignificant insights into the impact of our proposed protocols on the system performance overRayleigh fading channel. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical results.
